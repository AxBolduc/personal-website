An application commissioned by Brigham and Women's Hospital, as part of a university course, to serve as a service request and hospital pathfinding kiosk.

As a member of a 10 developer team I implemented core features of the application including A\* pathfinding, implementation of the hospital map and gesture controls, and various GUI improvements and features in JavaFx.

Throughout the course we learned the core AGILE development principles and practiced working as professional developers on an AGILE team. We also learned about core Object-Oriented Development principles: Inheritance, Polymorphism, and SOLID.

## Features

- Service requests of various types
- Admin portal to assign and handle open service requests
- A\* Pathfinding across multiple floors and a custom hospital map
- Google Maps style gesture control for the hospital map
- Build in map editor that allows users to add waypoints and paths
- Interactive chatbot to assist users with the application
- Mini arcade with games to play in the waiting room
